Generate conventional commits using `OpenAI` based on `git diff`

# ðŸ“– Usage

You must have `jq`, `git`, `tail`, `sed`, and `curl` installed on your system. If you're a developer, you probably already have them installed.
For those who need to install these tools, here are the commands for different operating systems:

```bash
# macOS
brew install jq git curl tail sed

# Linux (Debian-based)
sudo apt install jq git curl tail sed

# Linux (Red Hat-based)
sudo dnf install jq git curl tail sed

# Linux (Arch-based)
sudo pacman -S jq git curl tail sed
```

Once you have ensured that all the necessary tools are installed, navigate to any project directory that uses `git`. Within this directory, you can run the following command to execute the commit script:

```bash
$ curl -s http://commit.jaw.dev/commit.sh | sh
```

ðŸ’‹ðŸŽ¤ðŸ‘‹ BOOM!
